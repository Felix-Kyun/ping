# Ping Pong

My attempt to learn lua by building a game with lua and love.

## running 
- install dependencies 
    ```bash
    pacman -S lua love
    ```
- clone repo 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Felix-Kyun/ping
    cd ping
    ```
- run the start script 
    ```bash
    ./ping
    ```
- build to .love format
    ```bash
    ./build
    ```
